List of possible loot inside the crates… 
you can use *classnames* of items, *LC_Tables* for more randomiza on and, *LC_predifinied* Weapons.  
How Lootchest spawn Items? 
The Lootchest will always take all Entrys from this List, depending on the “lootrandomize“ factor… 
if you add a „*LC_Table* in this List, the Lootchest will ALWAYS pick ONE random item from this Table! 
If you want eg. 5 Items form a specific *LC_Table* , you need to add this one mul ple mes! 
I recomend to add large Items or Weapons in the top sec on of the list, because these need alot of space!  
Next part “ LCPredefinedWeapons“ will contains all Informa ons 
about your already assembled Weapon Presets...

Next part “ LootCategories“ will contains all Informa ons about your

Important:

“   
LootChestsTools_V106.json: 
The last part “ LCTools“ will contains all Informa ons how the Keys 
and Tools are working... 
Important! 
Do not remove any of the Tools or Keys from the Default config!!!

( -1 deac vate this op on for all LootChests! ). 
"dmg": 33, 
how much damage in % the tool take when you unlocked a Lootchest.  
( If you want a Tool or Key be usable only once, set “dmg“:100 )  
"desc": "NAME of KEY|DESCRIPTION of KEY" 
here you can change Name and Descrip on of the Keys only!  
Important:   
Eg.:           
You MUST use these type of entry: "name|descrip on" 
So you can  customize the Keys to give players hints… 
"Red Key|This key will open a crate hidden somewhere at the military airfield." 
Now i will give you some “dirty work-arounds“ to make the mod 
some kind of more randomness... 
Example 1: 
You dont want to have each Restart the same amount of Lootchests? 
Eg: You have a Building with 5 possible Loca ons and want 1-3 
Lootchests… 
Then add 2 more Loca ons far outside o he Map boarder, eg 
“-10000 0 -10000|0 0 0“, 
So 2 Chests will have the chance not to spawn inside the Building. 
So the Players cant be 100% sure to find every me all Chests… 
Example 2: 
You want have a Table with one very rare item in it and a very low 
chance to get this item? 
Eg: You want to have a Food-Chest with 90% apples and 10% Rice? 
Easy! Add in the Table the Apple 9 mes and the Rice only once…
