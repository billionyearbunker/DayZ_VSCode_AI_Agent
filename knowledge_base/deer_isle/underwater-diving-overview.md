# DayZ Map: Deer Isle - Underwater Operations & Diving

## 1. The "JMC" Underwater Loot Crates

Deer Isle features a custom, map-specific mechanic created by the map developer (JohnMcLane) that spawns high-tier loot crates on the ocean floor.

**The Mechanic:** You cannot see these crates with the naked eye from the surface. You must use a specific item to locate them.

**Required Item:** Underwater Beacon Tracker.

**How it works:** When held, it beeps or indicates distance to the nearest submerged crate. The frequency increases as you get closer.

**Loot:** These crates often contain high-tier items, building supplies, or "JMC" branded tactical gear that is rare on land.

**Location:** Spawns are dynamic (randomized) across the ocean, requiring a boat and a tracker to hunt effectively.

## 2. Key Submerged Locations

### The Underwater Caves

Deer Isle is famous for hidden caves that are only accessible by swimming through underwater sumps (tunnels).

**The "Secret" Base Locations:** There are several cave systems (e.g., near the scattered islands in the South/Southwest) where the entrance is fully submerged. Players must swim through a dark tunnel to emerge in an air pocket inside a rock formation.

**Tactical Value:** These are the most secure base locations on the map because they are invisible from the air and land.

### The Temple Drop

**Location:** Inside the main Temple (Southwest).

**Mechanic:** One of the only ways to access the lower "Treasure Rooms" or escape the summit is a blind drop into a deep internal well.

**Danger:** If you miss the water, you die. If you do not have a light source, you will likely get lost in the submerged tunnels at the bottom.

### Deepwater Oil Rigs

**Location:** The legs/pylons of the Oil Rigs.

**Loot:** While the main loot is on the deck, players often hide barrels or sea chests attached to the underwater pylons of the rigs to stash gear, as few players check deep underwater.

## 3. Diving Logistics & Gear

DayZ water mechanics are harsh. Navigating these areas requires specific preparation.

### Essential Gear

**Drybag Backpack:** Mandatory. If you swim with a standard bag, your gear will get heavy (draining stamina) and wet (freezing you). A Drybag keeps contents dry.

**Glowsticks / Chem Lights:** Flashlights do not work well underwater. Crack a chem light and attach it to your vest before diving to see tunnel walls.

**NBC Respirator / Gas Mask:** Note: In vanilla DayZ, these do not provide oxygen. However, many Deer Isle servers run mods (like "Mass's Many Items") that add functional Scuba Tanks. Always check server mods.

**Vanilla Mechanic:** Oxygen is tied to your Stamina Bar. If you run out of stamina, you begin to drown (lose health).

### Survival Tactics

**The "Stamina Rule":** Never dive with less than 100% stamina. If you are heavy (low stamina cap), you will likely drown before reaching the cave entrance.

**Hypothermia:** The ocean in Deer Isle is cold. You will start freezing quickly.

- **Counter:** Pre-heat yourself by a fire (get the + heat buff) before a long swim.

**Visibility:** Third-person camera often glitches underwater. Switch to First Person to see cave entrances clearly.

## 4. Threats of the Deep

**Drowning:** The most common cause of death. Panic leads to disorientation in caves.

**Sharks:** Server Dependent. The base Deer Isle map does not have sharks, but many servers add the "PvE Animals" mod which adds Great Whites to the deep ocean.

**Glitches:** Avoid swimming directly under the map geometry in tight caves; if the game thinks you are "inside" a wall, it may kill you instantly.

## Agent Context Notes

**Map Knowledge:** The Underwater Beacon Tracker is a high-value item often ignored by new players who don't know what it does. Instruct the agent to value this item highly.

**Base Raiding:** If a player cannot find a base on land, it is almost certainly in an underwater cave. These require rebreathers (if modded) or precise swimming to raid.

**Stamina:** Diving is impossible with heavy armor. Players often have to strip naked (drop Plate Carrier) to make the dive, leaving them vulnerable when they surface.
