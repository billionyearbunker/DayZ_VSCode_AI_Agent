# DayZ Map: Deer Isle - Loot Tier Distribution

**Important Note for Agents:** Unlike Chernarus, which has a linear South-to-North progression, Deer Isle uses an "Island & Keycard" progression system. The best loot is physically isolated by water or locked behind keycard blast doors.

## 1. Standard Loot Tiers (Civilian & Survival)

These zones function similarly to vanilla DayZ, offering basic survival gear, food, and low-caliber weapons.

### Tier 1: Coastal Spawn Zones (South & East)

**Locations:** Stonington, Eastbrook, Oceanville, and the Southern Coastline.

**Loot:**

- **Weapons:** BK-18, IJ-70, Sporters, Pump Action Shotguns.
- **Gear:** Civilian clothing, basic backpacks, simple tools (Knives, Can Openers).
- **Food:** High density of canned goods in residential houses.

### Tier 2: Inland Settlements (Central)

**Locations:** Portland, Westbrook, Waldoboro.

**Loot:**

- **Weapons:** CR-527, Repeater Carbines, SK 59/66, Pistols (Glocks/Mlock).
- **Gear:** Hunting gear (Hunter Pants/Jackets), Stab Vests, Hiking Backpacks.

**Note:** These towns are the primary "filtering" zones where fresh spawns move to get their first hunting rifle.

## 2. Military Loot Tiers (Accessible)

These areas can be accessed on foot or by swimming but are heavily contested.

### Tier 3: Standard Military

**Locations:** Paris Island, Power Plant, Swamp Military Checkpoints.

**Loot:**

- **Weapons:** SG5-K, USG-45, KA-74, M16-A2.
- **Gear:** BDU clothing, Combat Helmets, Tactical Vests, Field Backpacks.

**Tactical:** This is where players usually find their first automatic weapon.

### Tier 4: Heavy Military

**Locations:** Alcatraz Prison, The Swamp (Fort Knox), Small Northwest Islands.

**Loot:**

- **Weapons:** KA-M, M4-A1, LAR, VSD.
- **Gear:** Plate Carriers, High-Capacity Vests, NVGs (Night Vision).

**Requirement:** Accessing Alcatraz requires a boat or a long swim (high risk).

## 3. The "Keycard" Progression Tiers (End-Game)

Deer Isle's unique loot economy revolves around these zones. They often require specific keys found in lower tiers to access.

### The Oil Rigs (The Gatekeepers)

**Type:** Offshore Platforms.

**Loot:** High-tier military + Keycards.

**Role:** Players farm these locations primarily to find the Orange/Purple Keycards needed for KMUC or Area 42.

### KMUC (Katahdin Military Underground Complex)

**Location:** Inside Mt. Katahdin.

**Loot:** Tier 4/5 Military.

**Requirement:** Purple Keycard (standard server config) to open the blast doors.

**Special:** often contains the best non-quest loot on the map (Grenade Launchers, heavy sniper ammo).

### Area 42 (Radioactive Zone)

**Location:** Far East Island.

**Loot:** Experimental/High-Tech.

**Requirement:** NBC Suit (Radiation) + Keycard (for underground labs).

**Special:** This is a hazardous environment. If you die here, your body is difficult to recover.

### The Arctic (Tier 6 / "God Tier")

**Location:** Far North Ice Sheet.

**Loot:** JMC Prototype, Snow Owl Sniper, Tier 5 Military.

**Requirement:**

- **Boat:** It is too far to swim.
- **Warmth:** Extreme cold (Arctic gear/Heat packs required).
- **Keycard:** To access the Aircraft Carrier vault.

**Mechanic:** This is the highest tier on the map. The loot here is often unique to the map and cannot be found anywhere else.

## Agent Context Notes

**Loot Cycling:** Because the map is large, "loot cycling" (picking up items to force new spawns) is common in Stonington (Police Stations) and Paris Island (Barracks).

**The "Run":** The standard player progression is:

1. Spawn South (Stonington).
2. Gear up in Portland (Inland).
3. Hit Paris Island (Military).
4. Find a Boat.
5. Hit Oil Rigs for Keycards.
6. Hit KMUC or Area 42.
7. End Game: The Temple or The Arctic.
