# DayZ Map: Deer Isle - Helicopter Crash Sites (Heli Crashes)

## 1. Crash Site Mechanics

Unlike standard buildings, Heli Crashes are Dynamic Events.

**Dynamic vs. Static:** While there are a few static (permanent) crashes that are part of the map scenery (usually low loot), the high-tier loot comes from dynamic crashes that spawn randomly and despawn after a set time (usually 30-45 minutes).

**The Smoke:** Active crash sites emit a tall plume of black smoke. This is visible from kilometers away, making them a beacon for PVP.

**The Sound:** When a crash spawns near you, you will hear a distinct engine failure sound followed by a crash.

## 2. High-Probability Crash Zones

While crashes can happen almost anywhere on flat terrain, Deer Isle has specific "Hot Zones" where they cluster due to the available flat land.

### A. The Northern Ice Sheets (The Arctic)

- **Why:** The massive flat glaciers provide the perfect spawn conditions for the game engine.
- **Visibility:** The black smoke against the white ice is visible from virtually anywhere in the North.
- **Risk:** Extreme. You have zero cover approaching the crash, and snipers can watch the smoke from the mountains or the Aircraft Carrier.

### B. The Central Fields (Portland / Westbrook)

- **Why:** The large agricultural fields between Portland and Westbrook are prime spawn locations.
- **Tactical:** These are easier to approach than the Arctic because of tree lines and hay bales, but they are high-traffic areas for players moving inland.

### C. The Swamp (Southeast)

- **Why:** The flat, marshy areas around Oceanville and Fort Knox.
- **Difficulty:** Looting these is dangerous because movement speed is reduced in the water, making you a sitting duck for zombies or players.

### D. Area 42 Surroundings

- **Why:** The flat sandy islands near the Area 42 bridge.
- **Note:** These often spawn high-tier NBC gear in addition to weapons.

## 3. The Loot Table (What to Expect)

Heli crashes on Deer Isle share the highest loot tier with KMUC and the Arctic.

- **Weapons:** LAR (FAL), VSD (SVD), VSS Vintorez, AS VAL, M4-A1, KAM.
- **Gear:** Ghillie Suits (and components), Large Backpacks (Field Bags), NVGs (Night Vision).
- **Keycards:** Crucial Note: On Deer Isle, heli crashes have a chance to spawn Purple or Red Keycards on the ground around the wreck. Always check the floor carefully!

## 4. Types of Crashes

Deer Isle often features two distinct types of crash sites depending on the server configuration:

### Russian (Mi-8):
- **Visual:** Large, green transport helicopter.
- **Loot:** typically spawns Eastern bloc weapons (VSD, KAM, KA-101) and Russian optics.

### American (UH-1Y Venom):
- **Visual:** Smaller, grey/black utility helicopter.
- **Loot:** Typically spawns Western weapons (LAR, M4-A1, M16) and NATO optics.

## 5. Hunting Strategy

**The "Loop":** The most efficient way to hunt crashes is to drive or fly (if modded) a circuit around the Central Fields (Portland area).

**The Audio Cue:** Turn your volume up. Hearing the crash spawn gives you a massive advantage; you know exactly when it landed, meaning you have ~30 minutes before it despawns, and likely ~5-10 minutes before other players arrive.

### The Zombie Guard:
Crashes are guarded by "Infected Military Personnel."

- **Tactic:** If you see a crash without zombies around it, a player has likely already been there (or is currently there). Approach with extreme caution.
- **Kill the Officer:** Look for the zombie wearing the Officer Hat. On many servers, he drops specific loot or keycards.

## Agent Context Notes

- **Map Markers:** Agents should note that players often mark "Static" (scenery) crashes on third-party maps like iZurvive. Do not confuse these with "Dynamic" crashes. Static crashes usually have no loot or very low-tier loot.
- **Despawn Timer:** If a player is standing too close to a crash site when the timer runs out, the crash will not despawn until they leave the area.
- **C130 Crashes:** Deer Isle has a unique static C130 crash site (often in the swamp or dense forest). This is usually a scenery object or a custom trader zone, not a dynamic event.
