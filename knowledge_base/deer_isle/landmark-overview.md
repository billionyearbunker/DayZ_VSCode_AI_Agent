# DayZ Map: Deer Isle - Major Landmarks & Locations

## 1. Geography & Biomes

**Mount Katahdin:** The central peak of the map. It serves as the primary navigation point and houses the secret KMUC (Katahdin Military Underground Complex) entrance.

**The Arctic (North):** A frozen biome in the far north containing ice sheets, polar bears, and the Arctic Aircraft Carrier. Requires high insulation gear.

**The Swamp (Southeast):** A treacherous wetland area near Oceanville. Movement is slowed here, and it contains specific military checkpoints and "Fort Knox."

**The Crater:** A massive geological formation on its own island, often associated with high-tier loot and cave entrances.

## 2. Major Settlements (Civilian)

**Stonington:** The largest city on the map, located in the south. It features dense urban combat, high-tier civilian loot, and a large port area.

**Portland:** A major town situated centrally, often a hub for players moving inland from the coast.

**Waldoboro:** A significant town located southeast of Mt. Katahdin.

**Westbrook:** A large town on the western side of the main landmass.

**Oceanville:** A coastal town in the east, acting as the gateway to the Swamp biome.

**Rockenheim:** A town located in the rocky northern regions, bordering the transition to higher tier zones.

## 3. Military & High-Security Zones

**Area 42:** A massive, isolated military zone in the far east. It is a high-radiation zone usually requiring a full NBC suit and keycards to access the underground labs.

**Paris Island:** A large island in the southwest dedicated entirely to a military base. It includes barracks, industrial areas, and an underground bunker system.

**Alcatraz Prison:** A prison island located far south. It is difficult to access (requires swimming or a boat) and offers high-tier police and military loot.

**Swamp Military (Fort Knox):** A heavily fortified compound located within the Swamp biome.

**Power Plant:** An industrial complex with military presence, often containing underground tunnels.

## 4. Quest & Special Locations

**The Temple:** A massive Mayan-style temple located on an island in the southwest. It is the final destination for the map's primary "quest" and requires solving puzzles (crypts) to access.

**KMUC (Katahdin Military Underground Complex):** A secret underground bunker inside Mt. Katahdin. Access usually requires a keycard (often found at Oil Rigs or Area 42).

**Arctic Aircraft Carrier:** A frozen aircraft carrier stranded in the northern ice sheets. It is a Tier 5/6 loot zone and often holds keycards.

**Oil Rigs:** Several offshore platforms (e.g., The North Rig) that serve as mid-to-late game loot locations and keycard spawn points.

**Devil's Eye:** A mysterious crater/cave location known for unique terrain and difficult traversal.

**The Crypts:** Various underground dungeons scattered across the map (e.g., near churches or graveyards) that contain lore items necessary for the Temple quest.

## 5. Minor Islands

**Rotten Island:** A small, desolate island often used for base building or quick loot stops.

**Crater Island:** The landmass hosting the large crater feature.

**Barringer Island:** located off the coast, often serving as a transit point.

**Swan Island:** A remote island location.

## Agent Context Notes

**Navigation:** Players cannot swim to all islands; boats are heavily encouraged for Area 42, The Temple, and Oil Rigs.

**Progression:** The map follows a loose tier system where the South is generally lower tier, and the North (Arctic) and East (Area 42) are end-game zones.

**Underground:** Deer Isle is famous for its verticality; always check for cave entrances or cellar doors in military zones.
