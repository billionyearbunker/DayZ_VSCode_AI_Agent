# DayZ Map: Deer Isle - "Smokey" (The Smoke Monster)

## 1. Entity Overview

**Designation:** The Entity / "Smokey" / The Security System.

**Origin:** A direct Easter Egg and homage to the TV show Lost (which heavily inspired the Deer Isle map).

**Visuals:** Appears as a swirling, aggressive cloud of black smoke, often accompanied by electrical sparks or flashes.

**Nature:** It is not a zombie or an animal. It is an anomaly/hazard entity designed to force player movement or guard specific high-value areas.

## 2. Audio & Warning Signs (Detection)

The most critical survival tool against Smokey is audio.

**The "Clicking":** Before it appears or attacks, players will often hear a distinct mechanical "ticking" or "ratcheting" sound (like a roller coaster chain lift).

**The Roar:** It emits a terrifying, mechanical screech/roar when it spots a target or charges.

**Ambient Shift:** The immediate area may become darker or have altered ambient sound (wind stopping) when it is nearby.

## 3. Locations & Spawn Conditions

Smokey does not roam the entire map randomly; it is tethered to specific zones or events.

### A. The Temple (Southwest)

- **Role:** The Guardian.
- **Trigger:** It often spawns in the jungle surrounding the Temple or within the Temple grounds themselves to prevent players from camping the entrance.

### B. The Swamp (Southeast)

- **Role:** The Hunter.
- **Trigger:** Can be found patrolling the dense marshlands near Fort Knox. The trees and water usually make it hard to spot until it is too late.

### C. "The Darkness" Event (Server Dependent)

- **Mechanic:** On many servers, there is a timed event where the entire map goes pitch black (regardless of the actual time of day).
- **The Threat:** During this darkness, "Smokey" entities may spawn near players or in towns.
- **Defense:** Players must find a light source (Fire barrel, flare, chemlight) or stay indoors to avoid being hunted during the event.

## 4. Combat & Survival Strategy

**Do not engage.**

**Invulnerability:** Smokey is generally immune to small arms fire, explosives, and melee attacks. Shooting it only wastes ammunition and reveals your position to other players.

**Damage Output:** It deals massive shock and physical damage. Contact usually results in being knocked unconscious immediately, followed by death.

### The "Run" Meta:

- **Speed:** It is fast, but it can be outmaneuvered around obstacles.
- **Interiors:** It can sometimes struggle to enter small doorways, but do not rely on this; it has been known to clip through walls (noclip) in certain versions.
- **Water:** Unlike zombies, it can hover/fly over water, so swimming is not a guaranteed escape.

## 5. Lore Connection

For players interested in the story:

**The "Security System":** In the map's lore, Smokey is the defense mechanism for the island's secrets (KMUC/Temple), possibly created by the same experiments that caused the zombie outbreak or the portals.

**The Sound:** The sounds used are identical to the Smoke Monster from Lost, keeping with the theme of the Hatch, the Numbers, and the Polar Bears found on the map.

## Agent Context Notes

- **Psychological Warfare:** The sound of Smokey alone is often enough to make squads retreat. It is a powerful area-denial tool.
- **Server Config:** Agents must note that server admins can disable Smokey. If a user asks "Why can't I find the smoke monster?", it is likely disabled in the server's init.c or config files to improve server performance (as particle effects can cause lag).
- **Night Time:** It is hardest to see at night. If you hear the "ticking" in the dark, the standard protocol is to sprint in the opposite direction immediately.
