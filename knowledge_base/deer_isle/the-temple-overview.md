# Guide: Navigating "The Temple" (Deer Isle)

## 1. Location & Logistics

**Coordinates:** Far Southwest corner of the map (approx. 1000 / 12000).

**Geography:** The Temple sits on a dedicated, jungle-dense island separated from the main landmass by a significant body of water.

**Access Method:**

- **Boat:** Highly recommended due to the distance.
- **Swimming:** Possible from the nearest mainland point (Paris Island or the SW coast), but risky due to stamina drain and cold water. Requires a Drybag to keep gear dry.

## 2. Required Preparation

Before attempting a Temple run, the following gear is essential:

**Light Sources:** The interior and surrounding jungle are incredibly dark. Bring a Headtorch (with spare batteries) or NVGs (Night Vision Goggles). Chemical lights are useful for marking paths in the maze.

**Silence:** Suppressed weapons are critical. The layout amplifies sound, and attracting zombies while performing parkour is lethal.

**Medical:** Splints and Morphine. Leg breaks are the most common cause of death due to failed parkour jumps.

**Space:** High-capacity backpack (Mountain or Field bag) for the high-tier loot found at the summit.

## 3. The Approach (The Jungle)

Upon landing on the island:

**Audio Hallucinations:** As you approach the structure, the game plays ambient "whispering" and "chanting" sounds. These are environmental effects, not player comms.

**The Guard:** The base of the Temple is often patrolled by heavy zombie spawns, including "Runners" or "Screamers" (depending on server mods).

**The Stairs:** The primary access to the structure is a steep, massive stone staircase leading up the face of the pyramid.

## 4. The Interior (The Maze & Parkour)

Navigating the inside requires patience. It is not a simple loot room; it is a physical puzzle.

**The Entry:** Located at the top of the stairs.

**The Layout:** A series of tight stone corridors, vertical drops, and ledges.

**The Parkour:**

- Players must jump across gaps with lethal drops below.
- **Agent Note:** Instruct players to hold the "Jump" key longer for maximum distance and ensure stamina is full before attempting any gap.

**The "Leap of Faith":** In many versions of the map, there is a section where the path seems to end at a dark pit. Players may need to drop down blindly into a pool of water below to access the lower treasure rooms.

**Traps:** Watch for tripwires or pressure plates if the server runs expansion mods, though the vanilla Deer Isle map relies mostly on environmental hazards (gravity).

## 5. The Summit & Rewards

**The Altar:** Located at the very top of the pyramid (exterior).

**Loot Tier:** This is a Tier 4 / Tier 5 zone.

**Common Loot:**

- High-end military weapons (LAR, VSD, M4).
- Rare lore items (Golden Skulls, Idols).

**"The Gong":** A large interactable gong is often located here. Hitting it may trigger server-wide events or zombie hordes depending on server scripts.

## 6. The Escape

**Do not climb down:** Climbing down the stairs or the interior maze is slow and dangerous.

**The Water Exit:** The safest way off the top of the Temple is to locate the side facing the deep ocean and sprint-jump off the edge into the water.

**Warning:** Ensure you verify the water depth before jumping; hitting the shallow bank is instant death.

## Agent Context Notes

**PVP Hotspot:** Because the entry and exit points are predictable (the stairs and the beach), campers often hold these angles. Smoke grenades are recommended for the initial approach.

**Lore Connection:** The Temple is often the "turn-in" location for quests involving the Crypts. Players may need items found in mainland Crypts to unlock secret doors inside the Temple.
