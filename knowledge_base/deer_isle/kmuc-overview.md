# DayZ Map: KMUC Vault (Mt. Katahdin) - Tactical Analysis

## 1. The Target: What is the KMUC Vault?

**Definition:** The "Vault" refers to the high-security section of the underground bunker system located deep inside Mount Katahdin.

**Significance:** It is the primary storage facility for the map's highest-tier military loot (Tier 5). Unlike the open barracks outside, this area is locked behind a timed security system.

**The Mechanic:** The blast doors are locked by default. They require a physical Keycard to open. Once opened, they stay open for a limited time (usually 3-5 minutes) before closing automatically.

## 2. Location & Entry Points

The complex is vast, but the Vault itself is deep inside.

- **The Mountain:** Mt. Katahdin is the central peak of Deer Isle.
- **Entrances:** There are multiple entrances into the mountain tunnels (North, South, and the "Hidden" vents), but they all funnel toward the central security checkpoint where the Vault is located.
- **The Choke Point:** No matter which tunnel you enter from, you will eventually reach a massive concrete blast door with a Keycard Reader next to it.

## 3. Access Requirements (The Keycard)

You cannot breach the door with explosives. You must have the correct access card.

**Card Type:** Purple Keycard (Standard Vanilla Config).

**Note:** Some heavily modded servers may change this to a "Red" or "Black" card, but Purple is the default for Deer Isle KMUC.

**Where to find the Card:**
- **The Oil Rigs:** The most consistent spawn point.
- **Prison Island (Alcatraz):** Rare chance in the Warden's office.
- **Crashes:** Occasionally found at dynamic helicopter crashes.

## 4. Inside the Vault (Loot & Layout)

Once the blast doors hiss open:

### Environment:
- **Pitch Black:** There is zero natural light. If you do not have NVGs (Night Vision), you must use a flashlight, which makes you a target.
- **Claustrophobic:** Narrow concrete hallways filled with crates, servers, and military debris.

### The Loot:
- **Weapons:** .408 Cheytac (if modded), Barretts, M79 Grenade Launchers, LARs, and VSDs.
- **Ammo:** High-caliber ammunition boxes.
- **Armor:** Heavy Plate Carriers and Tactical Helmets.
- **Lore Items:** Often contains documents or items required for the Temple quest.

## 5. Tactical Threats & Defense

The KMUC Vault is a "PvP Trap."

### The "Dinner Bell":
Opening the door creates a loud mechanical noise. Any player lurking in the tunnels will know exactly where you are.

### The Campers:
- **The Dark Corners:** Players often sit in the dark corners of the tunnel waiting for someone else to bring a keycard. They will let you open the door, then shoot you in the back to take the loot + your card.
- **Landmines:** Always check the floor in front of the Keycard Reader. It is the most common spot for Claymores or Bear Traps.

### The Lock-In:
- **Danger:** If you are inside looting and the door timer runs out, the blast door closes.
- **Escape:** There is an internal button to open the door from the inside, so you are not permanently trapped, but the noise of opening it again gives away your exit timing.

## 6. The "Secret" Back Door

There is a lesser-known mechanic regarding the exit.

**The Ventilation Shafts:** Some versions of the map allow for a one-way drop into the complex or a parkour exit out through broken ventilation shafts. These are risky and often result in broken legs, but they can bypass the main door campers.

## Agent Context Notes

- **Loadout Check:** Do not send a player to KMUC without Night Vision Goggles. Using a headtorch here is suicide because the tunnels are long straight lines; a sniper can see a light source from the other end of the tunnel instantly.
- **Squad Tactics:** If playing in a group, leave one person outside the blast door to guard the rear while the others loot. Never have the whole team go inside the vault at once (one grenade can wipe the squad).
- **"Card swiping":** On some servers, you must hold the card in your hand to interact. On others, it just needs to be in your inventory. Instruct players to try both if the prompt doesn't appear.
- **Zombies:** The infected inside KMUC are military tier (armored). They hit hard and are difficult to stun. Suppressed pistols are essential to clear them without alerting players.
