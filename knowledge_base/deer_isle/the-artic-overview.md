# DayZ Map: The Arctic (North East) - Zone Analysis

## 1. Geography & Environment

**Location:** The region spans the far Northern edge of the map, with the densest points of interest (POI) concentrated in the North East.

**Biome:** Frozen Tundra / Ice Sheet.

**Temperature:** This is the coldest zone on the map. Without proper gear, players will enter hypothermia within minutes.

**Terrain:** Massive glaciers, floating ice sheets, and barren rock. There is very little natural cover (trees/bushes) once you step onto the ice, making you highly visible against the white background.

## 2. Key Locations & Landmarks

### The Aircraft Carrier (C.A.S.S. Wick)

**Description:** A massive, frozen aircraft carrier stuck in the ice. It serves as the "dungeon" of the North.

**Access:** Requires a boat to reach the ice edge, then a trek on foot.

**Features:**

- **Flight Deck:** Wide open, often containing helicopter spawns or crash sites.
- **Interior:** Tight corridors, flooded lower decks, and mess halls.
- **The Bridge:** High vantage point, good for scouting incoming boats.

### The Research Stations

**Description:** Orange or white scientific modular buildings scattered across the ice shelves.

**Loot:** Medical supplies (Epinephrine/Morphine), warmth (Heat packs), and building supplies.

**Tactical:** These are often the only places to get out of the wind and build a fire safely.

### The Oil Rig (North)

**Description:** Often considered part of the "Northern run," this rig sits just off the boundary of the ice. It is a primary source for keycards before pushing onto the ice itself.

## 3. Survival Requirements (The "Hard Check")

You cannot simply "run" to the Arctic. The environment acts as a gear check.

**Clothing:** You strictly need High Insulation gear.

- **Recommended:** Hunter gear, Winter specific camo, or NBC suits (if high insulation stats).
- **Essential:** Wool coats, Ushankas, Quilted Jackets.

**Heat Source:**

- **Heat Buff:** You should have the "+" heat buff active before leaving the boat.
- **Items:** Gas Stove + Canister (to dry clothes instantly), Heat Packs, or plenty of bark/firewood.

**Food:** Your calorie burn rate increases significantly when cold. Bring high-fat foods (Fat, Meat) rather than just canned veggies.

## 4. The Threats

**Polar Bears:** Unique to Deer Isle (and some other custom maps), these roam the ice sheets. They are significantly stronger than standard brown bears, have higher health pools, and blend into the white terrain.

**The Water:** Falling into the water in this region is almost a guaranteed death sentence. It ruins the insulation value of your clothes instantly and freezes you rapidly.

**Snipers:** Because the terrain is flat and white, players with high-magnification scopes (VSD/Mosins) can spot movement from kilometers away. Silhouettes stand out sharply.

## 5. Loot Overview (High Tier)

**Tier:** Tier 6 / Experimental.

**Exclusive Loot:**

- **Snow Owl:** A high-caliber sniper rifle often exclusive to this zone.
- **Arctic Camo Gear:** White variants of military gear (Plate carriers, helmets) that provide camouflage on the ice.
- **High-End Military:** M79 Grenade Launchers, LARs, M4s.
- **Keycards:** The Carrier often spawns high-tier keycards required for other dungeons (like the Temple or KMUC).

## Agent Context Notes

**Vehicle Strategy:** Do not drive a car here. The ice is slippery, and physics glitches can send cars flying. Helicopters are viable but risky due to the lack of cover for landing. Boats are the meta transport.

**"Drying" Tactic:** If a player gets wet, they must stop immediately. Wringing out clothes is not enough. They must build a fire or use a gas stove to reach "Dry" status before moving again.

**Visuals:** At night, the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) is often visible here, which can actually help with visibility without Night Vision Goggles.

**Engagement Rule:** If you spot another squad, engage at long range. Close-quarters combat is rare unless inside the Carrier.
