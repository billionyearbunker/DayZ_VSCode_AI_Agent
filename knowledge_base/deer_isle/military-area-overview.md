# DayZ Map: Deer Isle - Military Zones Overview

## 1. Major Open Military Bases (Mid-Tier)

These areas are accessible without keycards or special environmental gear (NBC/Warmth), but they are high-traffic PVP zones.

### Paris Island Military Base

**Location:** Southwest (SW) island, connected by a bridge (often broken or camped) or accessible by shallow swim.

**Structure:** A mix of industrial warehouses, military barracks, and tents.

**Loot:** Tier 3 Military (KA-74, M16, Standard Plate Carriers).

**Tactical:** This is the most popular "first stop" for fresh spawns leaving Stonington. Expect close-quarters combat (CQC).

### Stonington Military Outpost

**Location:** On the outskirts of the main city (Stonington).

**Structure:** Tents, guard towers, and a few barracks buildings.

**Risk:** Extremely High. Because it is near spawn points, it is a chaotic mix of geared players hunting fresh spawns and fresh spawns rushing for guns.

### The Power Plant

**Location:** Central / East.

**Structure:** A massive industrial complex with military tents and checkpoints surrounding it.

**Loot:** Mixed Industrial and Military. Good for finding building supplies and ammo.

**Feature:** Contains underground tunnels that can be confusing to navigate.

## 2. Restricted / Hard-to-Reach Bases (High-Tier)

These locations act as "gear checks." Players need vehicles, swimming skills, or specific items to survive here.

### Alcatraz Prison Island

**Location:** Far South (South of Stonington).

**Access:** Swimming (High stamina/Drybag required) or Boat. The swim is long enough to cause hypothermia or drowning if not managed correctly.

**Loot:** Tier 4 Military & High-Tier Police (Riot gear, Shotguns, Automatic Rifles).

**Layout:** Tight cell blocks, watchtowers, and a cafeteria. CQC is deadly here.

### Fort Knox (The Swamp)

**Location:** Deep in the Southeast Swamp biome.

**Environment:** Surrounded by shallow, muddy water that slows movement.

**Structure:** A wooden fortress reminiscent of Vietnam-era firebases.

**Threat:** The terrain makes escape difficult. If you are pinned down here, you are usually trapped.

### The Oil Rigs (North & East)

**Location:** Offshore platforms.

**Access:** Boat/Heli only.

**Loot:** High-Tier Weapons + Keycards.

**Tactical:** Snipers often camp the helipads or the boat ladders. There are very few entry points, making them easy to defend but hard to assault.

## 3. The "Dungeons" (End-Game / Restricted)

These are the most dangerous areas on the map, usually requiring keycards to enter the looting area.

### KMUC (Katahdin Military Underground Complex)

**Location:** Inside the main mountain (Mt. Katahdin).

**Entrance:** Various blast doors built into the rock face.

**Requirement:** Purple Keycard (usually).

**Environment:** Pitch black. Night Vision Goggles (NVGs) are mandatory. Flashlights will give away your position instantly.

**Loot:** The best weapons on the map (Grenade Launchers, .338 Snipers, 408 Cheytac).

### Area 42

**Location:** Far East Island.

**Hazard:** Radiation.

**Requirement:** Full NBC Suit (Gas Mask, Hood, Jacket, Pants, Boots, Gloves).

**Structure:** Above-ground labs (ruined) and a pristine underground bunker.

**Loot:** Experimental weapons (Gauss Rifle) and high-tier medical supplies.

## 4. Minor Checkpoints & Police Stations

While not "bases," these are critical for early game progression.

**Roadblocks:** Found on almost every main road leading out of Stonington and Portland. They spawn individual military items (helmets, vests) but rarely guns.

**Police Stations:** Located in every major town (Stonington, Westbrook, Portland, Oceanville).

- **Loot:** Scorpions, Glocks, MP5s, Shotguns, Stab Vests.
- **Note:** These are the most camped buildings in the game.

## Agent Context Notes

**Landmines:** Players frequently place landmines at the entrances of KMUC and the Stonington Barracks. Always check the floor before entering a doorway.

**Heli Crashes:** Unlike Chernarus, static helicopter crashes are less common, but dynamic crashes occur. However, the best loot is static in the zones listed above.

**The "Meta":** Smart players avoid the main roads into military bases. They approach Paris Island through the woods or approach the Power Plant from the ridge lines to scout for snipers first.
