# Expansion P2P Market System

The **Expansion Player-to-Player Market System** is a system that works outside and different from the Expansion market system. It allows you (the server owner) to create traders on defined positions on the map where players can sell and buy items from or to other players. Players can define their own prices for the items they sell and items that get listed for sale even take over all their conditions/attachments or cargo items.

**WORK IN PROGRESS** - Please note that the content of this page may change in the future and is not final!
