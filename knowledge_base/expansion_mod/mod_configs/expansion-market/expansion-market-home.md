# The Market System

The **Expansion Mod Market** is a player driven and stock based market system where players can gear up for their next great adventure, or get rid of unneeded loot, in exchange for currency.

Everything from the prices to the stock, the items each trader has and much more can be configured and controlled by the server hosters.
