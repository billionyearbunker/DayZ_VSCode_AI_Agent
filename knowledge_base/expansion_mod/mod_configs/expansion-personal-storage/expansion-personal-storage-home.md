# Expansion Personal Storage

---

The expansion personal storage system is a storage system that works outside and different from the normal DayZ container/cargo system. It allows you (the server owner) to create storages on defined positions on the map where players can deposit and retrieve items that can only be seen by the owned player. Depostited items can only be retrieved at the same storage where they have been deposited unless the certain storage is global storage.
