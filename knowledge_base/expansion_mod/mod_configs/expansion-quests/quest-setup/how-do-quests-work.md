## Quest Components

A quest always needs different components to get feeded with the right information to process and run the quest as intended.

1. **The quest NPC/s** that heads-out or takes-in the quest if the quest is not automaticly completed
2. **The objectives** the quest has and the player needs to complete to complete the whole quest
3. **The quest itself** with all the infomations like the quest NPCs, objectives and certain other data that will get displayed to the player under certain conditions

## Quest Requirements

A quest will only work and can be accepted when the configuration is complete and the player meets all the requirements to accept the quest.

Is a quest not getting diplayed when interacting with the certain Quest NPC then something is not right with the configuration.
