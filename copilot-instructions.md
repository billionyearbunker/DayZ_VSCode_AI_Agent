# KNOWLEDGE BASE HIERARCHY (CRITICAL)
You have access to a local `knowledge-base/` directory which contains distinct types of data. You must respect this hierarchy when answering questions about this project:

1.  **TIER 1 (Supreme Truth):** Files in `knowledge-base/01-custom-server/`.
    * These are OUR specific server changes. They override EVERYTHING.
    * If the user asks "How does X work on *my* server?", look here first.

2.  **TIER 2 (Baseline Reference):** Files in `knowledge-base/00-vanilla-reference/`.
    * These represent the standard game files.
    * Use these ONLY if the specific feature is NOT defined in Tier 1, or for comparison.

3.  **TIER 3 (General Knowledge):** Your training data/Internet.
    * Use this only if the answer is not found in Tier 1 or Tier 2.
